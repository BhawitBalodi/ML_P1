- train_data_path: str = os.path.join('artifact', 'train.csv') is a Python statement that defines a variable named train_data_path and initializes it with a string value. The string value is created using the os.path.join() function to join the two strings 'artifact' and 'train.csv' together, separated by the appropriate directory separator for the operating system.
